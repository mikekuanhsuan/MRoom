在工作上資料庫部分Oracle 跟 MS SQL 都有使用，使用 ETL 流程進行資料移動，並使用 Control-M 進行作業排程和監控。
這句英文要怎麼口說表達

So in my current role, I work with both Oracle and MS SQL databases.
I move data using ETL processes and manage job scheduling and monitoring with Control-M. This helps keep our systems stable and running efficiently.

----------

My main focus is on keeping systems reliable and running efficiently.

I work on automated data workflows and batch operations to ensure data is processed accurately and on time.

To maintain stability, we keep production and test environments separate, virtualize the application layer, and run databases on physical servers.

To support this work, I mainly use Oracle PL/SQL for data logic, ETL processes for data movement, and Control-M for scheduling and monitoring jobs.

I also have experience in C# development and collaborate with different teams to turn business requirements into reliable technical solutions.
