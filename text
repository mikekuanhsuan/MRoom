Opening & Current Role

Hi, I’m Kuan-Hsuan. 
I'm from Taiwan and I work for a bank in the IT department. 
I mainly deal with risk systems and a lot of financial data.


My main focus is on keeping systems reliable and running efficiently.

I work on automated data workflows and batch operations to ensure data is processed accurately and on time.


In my work, 
I work with both Oracle and MS SQL databases.
I move data using ETL processes and manage job scheduling and monitoring with Control-M. 
This helps keep our systems stable and running efficiently.
